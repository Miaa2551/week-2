                    <p>My name is Ivan Ramirez and I have 3 wonderful daughters and a beautiful wife.  I have lived in Dallas my whole life and dont have any plans on moving elsewhere.
                       We are a soccer family and enjoy every minute of it whether its playing or watching.  
                       I work for Gainsco Ins. as a Sr. QA Analyst and have been with the company for 10 years and over time I have developed a serious interest in coding.  I have always 
                       been interested in the IT field and now I get a chance to learn what I really think is my new passion.  I hope to learn more as we get deeper into the class but as for now im getting all the help
                       I can from youtube and online researches.
